Employ test files to ensure pgmEcho maintains correct results after modification, including boundary values of colour, excessive whitespace, and comments. Similar test files can be employed to verify all programmes (unit tests). All module dependencies will be tested, such as pgmImage functions and error detection (integration + functional tests). pgmComp will be tested against comments AND whitespace to validate solely logical equivalence. Tests will ensure modules return valid error codes.

Test all error conditions in all modules. Utilities pgma2b and pgmb2a will be tested mostly on boundary values of colour. pgmReduce will be tested with high, and low, dimensional values, especially those indivisible by the specified integer factor. All component images of output pgmTile must be tested against expected images, including boundary dimensions. Assembled images must be tested against their expected constructions using boundary dimensions and varyingly sized composing images.
