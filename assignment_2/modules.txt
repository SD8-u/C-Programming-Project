gtopoFormat – Handles operations involved in GTOPO manipulation including reading models, writing models, destruction operations (freeing allocated memory) and initialising gtopo structures. The module will be used in all other modules. This allows for effective modularisation as its means that reading/writing to these files will not require repeated code in other modules, reducing time wasted when increasing functionality.
gtopoError – Holds a set of functions for handling errors within gtopo models and to ensure proposed models are of the expected format. This will include checking whether bytes are correctly written, or whether there is too little/much data. Therefore, when reading or writing gtopo files, we can easily verify that they are valid and thereby avoid cascading failures. The module will use exceptionHandling.
exceptionHandling – In each gtopo program there are many places where the system must exit, and thus localising the process is logical. This module will handle exit messages, clean-up operations and errors that are external to gtopo models (such as invalid arg count, invalid filenames, freeing memory of non-gtopo related data). The effect of which should enable safe system closure and reduce redundancy in code. The module will be used in all programmes and most modules.
