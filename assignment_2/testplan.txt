Employ test files to ensure gtopo modules maintain correct results through testing with various samples from the data set. The test files can be employed toverify all programmes (unit tests) when making changes. All module dependencies will be tested, such as gtopoFormat functions and error detection (integration + functional tests). Tests will ensure modules return valid outputs, against what is expected. This will include assembling and printing parts of the dataset i.e., producing results that can be readily checked. 

Test all error conditions for error detection modules. gtopoReduce will be tested with the entire dataset, ensuring that it is reduced in memory before writing to disk. The dataset is 1.84GB which will test performance and stability. gtopoTile will be tested through essentially 'cropping' the dataset for specific parts of the world. Certain gtopo models will be both echoed, and compared, to verify both module's complementary operation.
